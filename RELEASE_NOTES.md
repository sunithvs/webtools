# Release Notes - Clens v1.0

## 🚀 Initial Release

We are excited to introduce **Clens**, the ultimate Chrome extension for developers to analyze image caching, size, and efficiency directly within the browser.

### ✨ Key Features

- **Instant Analysis**: Scans all images on the current page with a single click.
- **Cache Detection**: Identifies if images are served from **Memory Cache**, **Disk Cache**, or fetched over the **Network**.
- **Smart Filtering**:
  - Filter by **"Not Cached"** to spot unoptimized assets.
  - Filter by file type (JPG, PNG, WebP, SVG, GIF).
- **Size Sorting**: Automatically sorts images by file size to help you identify heavy assets slowing down your LCP.
- **Efficiency Suggestions**: Provides automated tips for format optimization (e.g., converting large PNGs to WebP) and missing cache headers.
- **Non-Intrusive UI**: Uses the Chrome Side Panel API to keep your debugging experience clean and side-by-side with your content.
- **Privacy First**: Runs locally in your browser with no background tracking or external data collection.
