# Release Notes - Clens v1.1

## 🚀 Version 1.1

We are excited to introduce **Clens v1.1**, featuring enhanced analysis capabilities and smarter suggestions.

### ✨ New Features

- **Advanced Cache Detection**: Now detects `no-cache`, `no-store`, and `max-age=0` headers to explain *why* an image isn't cached.
- **Dimensions Check**: Identifies images that are significantly larger than their display size, helping you save bandwidth.
- **Lazy Loading Suggestions**: Detects when multiple off-screen images are missing the `loading="lazy"` attribute.
- **Improved UI**: New warning badges and clearer efficiency tips.

### 🌟 Core Features

- **Instant Analysis**: Scans all images on the current page with a single click.

- **Smart Filtering**:
  - Filter by **"Not Cached"** to spot unoptimized assets.
  - Filter by file type (JPG, PNG, WebP, SVG, GIF).
- **Size Sorting**: Automatically sorts images by file size to help you identify heavy assets slowing down your LCP.
- **Efficiency Suggestions**: Provides automated tips for format optimization (e.g., converting large PNGs to WebP) and missing cache headers.
